# Assembly Algorithms

This repository contains many basic algorithms implemented in MIPS assembly.
I'm working on this project to better educate myself on writing low level code.

## Running the code in this repository

I recommend using [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/)
to run MIPS assembly code. With MARS, you can simply open any `.asm` file
from the `src` file and run it.
